**Tag Toolkit** is your ultimate browser extension for mastering the scripts and meta tags on any webpage.

Whether you're a **web developer**, **SEO specialist**, **digital marketer**, or just a curious mind, Tag Toolkit provides deep visibility into the inner workings of a website's tags and scripts—both on load and dynamically injected.

## 🔍 Key Features

- **Meta & Script Tag Overview**  
  Instantly view all meta and script tags loaded with the initial page content. Understand the site's structure and the scripts it relies on right from the start.

- **Dynamic & Asynchronous Tag Detection**  
  Detect scripts that are added dynamically after the initial load, such as those injected by third-party services like Google Tag Manager. The extension continuously monitors the DOM and updates results in real-time.

- **Search Functionality**  
  Easily search and filter through all detected tags and scripts to find exactly what you're looking for.

- **Tag Identification & Highlighting**  
  Automatically recognizes common scripts like Google Analytics and GTM, highlighting them clearly for faster analysis.

## ⚙️ How It Works

### 🧱 Meta & Script Tags Tab
Displays all meta and script tags present in the page source during the initial load, including:
- Inline scripts
- External script sources
- SEO-related meta tags

### 🚀 Dynamic & Asynchronous Tags Tab
Tracks and lists scripts that:
- Are added via JavaScript after page load
- Load asynchronously or via tag managers
- Continue loading dynamically as you interact with the page

This live monitoring ensures you don’t miss hidden or delayed tag injections.

## 🔐 Permissions

Tag Toolkit requests the following permissions:
- `activeTab`: To access the currently active page for analysis.
- `scripting`, `tabs`, `storage`: Used internally for script injection, tab tracking, and storing settings.

📌 **Privacy First**: All analysis is performed **locally** in your browser. **No data is ever transmitted externally.**
